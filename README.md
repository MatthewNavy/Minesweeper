# Minesweeper
This is just to give context to this project. This was done as a competition entry for SoHacks4, a 24-hour coding competition for high school students. I tried to emulate Minesweeper in the processing console. This code was not meant to be super readable nor efficient.
The SoHacks4.pde file is the main runner.
